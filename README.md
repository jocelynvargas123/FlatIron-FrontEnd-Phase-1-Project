#Water Your Plants

#Description

For my single-page app, I combined my two passions, plants and coding. The Water Your Plants app allows visitors to enter their plant name, information, upload a photo and choose how many days in between watering. After entering submit, a card is created with their information keeping track of the watering for them. The button will change when the date to water the plants has arrived or passed. 
Next, the gallery of photos in a slide show gives a few examples of a few common household plants. Finally the last section there's a list of tips that will help first-time plant enthusiasts.

#how to use App

When you enter the site the first thing you'll see are the title and navigation bar. Scroll down and you will enter your information as it is shown on the screen. Once finished press submit and the new plant card will be generated. Daily you can return to see which plants need to be watered soon or which still need a few days. 

#Project status

I will continue working on new features.
